# ss with v2ray-plugin on Doprax
you should use the client supporting ss with v2ray-plugin, like Matsuri on Android, shadowsocket on ios and so on. Clash is advised because Matsuri can not often be connected when visiting youtube and some other websites.

the ss configuration on Matsuri is like the following imageï¼š
